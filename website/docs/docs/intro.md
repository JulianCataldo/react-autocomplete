# Getting Started

### What's the problem?

- You require an autocomplete/select/search feature for your website, and you want it to be accessible.
- You begin by building one from scratch, but quickly realize that the implementation is not trivial.
- While searching for open-source alternatives, you find that many have significant bundle sizes, typically ranging from **10kB to 50kB**, and some do not support tree shaking.
- Furthermore, these options often do not offer the level of customization you need.

### What makes this solution unique?

- **Modular**: We carefully design the API with a modular approach, providing a no-frills solution that allows you to bundle only the code you need for your website. _No more and no less!_

- **Lightweight**: At just 1.4 kB, you get a fully functional and accessible autocomplete solution in React. It's almost negligible in size and likely lighter than creating one from scratch, so you can adopt it without hesitation.

- **Customizable**: Thanks to the modular design, you can easily customize existing features or even create your own feature (a plugin-style module) to enhance the solution.

### Sounds promising! How does it look?

Hereâ€™s a live example of the **1.4 kB** accessible React autocomplete solution:
